                    <h2>A Timeline of Modern Finance</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1952 (The Idea): </strong>Harry Markowitz publishes "Portfolio Selection". This is the first major mathematical model for investing, showing how to build a portfolio that balances risk and return. It's the birth of "Modern Portfolio Theory."</li>

                        <li><strong>1973 (The Formula): </strong>Fischer Black and Myron Scholes (with Robert Merton) publish the Black-Scholes-Merton model. This was a revolutionary breakthrough that provided a mathematical formula for pricing options (a type of derivative), which opened the floodgates for complex financial products.</li>

                        <li><strong>1980s (The Pioneers): </strong>Firms like Morgan Stanley and hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies begin using computers and mathematical models to find small, repeatable profits (known as "statistical arbitrage").</li>

                        <li><strong>1990s-2000s (The Speed): </strong>The rise of electronic trading leads to High-Frequency Trading (HFT). Quants now focus on "low-latency" (ultra-fast) code to execute trades in millionths of a second.</li>

                        <li><strong>2010s-Today (The Data): </strong>The focus shifts to Machine Learning and "Alternative Data." Quants now use AI to analyze huge, non-traditional datasets (like satellite images of parking lots or social media sentiment) to predict market moves.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Roles</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Researchers/Analysts:</strong> These professionals are primarily focused on discovering, developing, and backtesting new investment or trading strategies. They use vast, often high-frequency, datasets and advanced statistical methods to find patterns, market inefficiencies, and potential sources of "alpha" (profit in excess of a benchmark). They spend their time on model design, statistical analysis, and theoretical research.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Developers/Engineers:</strong> These Quants are expert programmers who implement, optimize, and maintain the high-performance computing systems that put the researchers' models into action. They build the robust, low-latency trading platforms, data pipelines, and analytical tools necessary for live-market execution. They bridge the gap between abstract mathematical models and production-ready software.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Strategy (Quant Strat):</strong> A systematic investment approach that uses mathematical and statistical models to make trading and investment decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Risk</strong> The process of analyzing risk using numerical data to assign a monetary value to both the likelihood of a risk occurring and its potential impact.</li>
                        <li><strong>Algorithmic Execution</strong> The use of mathematical models and algorithms to automatically and optimally execute trade orders. It focuses on getting the best possible price for a trade, minimizing market impact, and reducing transaction costs, rather than identifying the trade itself.</li>
                    </ul>
